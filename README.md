Background Image Slider

Third project I did today and this one was actually "intense". I did borrow images from unsplash but I also left urls in array
in app.js. There you can find owners of images I downloaded from unsplash. 

But still, had fun doing fucntionality on those buttons.

Taking a break and continuing in an hour or so.
